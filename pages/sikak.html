It provides a smart, digital solution that facilitates secure and efficient sharing of books and resources.

      <p>
        Many libraries have extra books that aren’t being used much. At the same time, other libraries need those same books but don’t have access to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This happens because there’s no clear system that helps libraries share books with each other. Without a way to connect, useful books stay unused, and chances to share knowledge are missed.
